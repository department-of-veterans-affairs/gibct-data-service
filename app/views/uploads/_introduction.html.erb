      These are the CSV files from which the database will be constructed.
      As the CSV is uploaded, a validation on every row in the CSV will ensure
      that there are no issues with the data. If successful, the uploaded data
      can be used to generate a new preview version. If there are any issues, error
      messages detailing the row(s) in the CSV causing those errors will be output.
      Be aware, however, that some issues will arise because free text is embedded
      in the rows of CSV files. These types of issues can safely be ignored.
