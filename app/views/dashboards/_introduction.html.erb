      These are the CSV files from which the database will be constructed.
      As the CSV is uploaded, a validation on every row in the CSV will ensure
      that there are no issues with the data. If successful, the uploaded data
      can be used to construct the Data.csv. Data may be uploaded in any desired
      order, and once all new CSV data has been uploaded, a preview version
      of the GI Bill Comparison Tool database may be built. If you are satisfied
      that the data is correct, you may "publish" the preview version of the
      database to production.
